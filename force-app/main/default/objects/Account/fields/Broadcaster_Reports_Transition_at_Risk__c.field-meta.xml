    <description>I left the broadcaster reports transtiion field name the same, because I didn&apos;t want to risk messing with reports. But Broadcaster Reports Transition at Risk is the same as Outreach Reports Transition at risk. (Change made 7/17/2018, due to Mark Combs request).</description>
    <externalId>false</externalId>
    <inlineHelpText>Completed by the Outreach Team if the Broadcaster reports they are at risk of missing their phase completion date. Checking the box generates a request for an analysis of the impact to our sites if the station misses its date.</inlineHelpText>
